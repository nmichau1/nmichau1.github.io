<h2> Where to eat in Barcelona? - Follow the guide, avoid mistakes!</h2>

<p> Where to eat in Barcelona is a crucial issue. A question we ask ourselves every day. In this restaurant guide of Barcelona we include the work of our gastronomic discoveries, for weeks, filtered to speak only of restaurants that have true creativity, impeccable quality of the products, decoration, pleasant service and, finally, a checked value for money. The restaurants we list in this guide are only our favorites, not a list of all the restaurants in Barcelona.
<br><br>
 In this guide "Where to eat in Barcelona?" we inform you of our favorite restaurants and we do not make an exhaustive list of all the restaurants in town
<br>
<br>
 Some vocabulary
<br>
 Breweries (cervecerías), as the name implies, serve beer, but we can usually find craft or special beers, as well as all kinds of drinks, soft drinks, coffees, wines, etc., as well as bars. For a full meal, we will go to a restaurant and for a seafood meal to a marisquería. The inn or hostel offers family cuisine. The bodega is a wine bar, a chiringuito is a bar restaurant by the sea. The grangas are a kind of small cafes, where the Catalans come to enjoy breakfast, or tea or afternoon snack. Finally, the Paradores, considered as luxury hotels, are surprisingly affordable with respect to its restoration.
<br><br>
 In Barcelona, ​​lunch is usually served from 2 pm to 4 pm and dinner from 9 pm to midnight. Restaurants in Barcelona often close on Sunday evenings and Mondays.
 Walking: ok and obvious, but also the best way to visit the Old Town, Gothic quarter streets, the old fisherman’s village of Barceloneta and the beach, the fantastic Palau de la Musica Catalana in the Borne district, leading you all the way over to the garden of Barcelona – La Cuitadella . This is a huge part of Barcelona and is a really great way to spend a day, believe me.
<br><br>
<br>

Buses and Metro: Metro stations are the best way to move around and the fastest way. You can buy a 2 day (11.20€) or 3 day (15.90€) tickets. You can combine the metro with the bus system, and the new "tranvía".
With the public transportation system, you will save time, money and will be more ecological.
For a global visit, we recommend to use the Bus Turistic, that has 2 different routes and visits the major tourist places in Barcelona. Also called the Hop-on Hop-off Bus.
<br><br>


Car Rental : If you will be visiting for a few days and have limited time, do not bother renting a car. Otherwise you can rent a car to go outside the city and visit the Costa Brava, Montserrat or other places worth if you have the time and already visited Barcelona.
Also, the Barcelona Card gives nice discounts on transportation and museums.
