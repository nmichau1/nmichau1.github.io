### THE PROBLEM
Manually predicting housing prices was taking too long and had a high margin of error. Stakeholders needed a reliable tool.

::: {.brutal-card style="background-color: #2D5BFF; color: white;"}
### THE SOLUTION
I built a Random Forest Regressor that automates the process, reducing error by 40% and providing instant valuations.

## 📈 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

*Insight: We found that location had a 3x higher impact on price than the number of bedrooms.*

## 💻 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION


::: {.brutal-card}
### THE LOGIC
I used a `StandardScaler` to ensure the housing features were on the same scale, which improved the model convergence time.

:::: {.panel-tabset .brutal-tabs}

## 🐍 PREPROCESSING
<div class="code-tab">model_preprocessing.py</div>
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

## 🐍 PRNGsdsdd
<div class="code-tab">01_LOAD_DATA.PY</div>
```python
    THIS IS THE COE FOR PART 2
```

## 🐍 Psdsdsd
<div class="code-tab">01_LOA.PY</div>
```python
    THIS IS THE COE FOR PART 3
```

### 💡 LESSONS LEARNED
1. **Feature Engineering:** Simple features often beat complex ones.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Spending 80% of the time on cleaning was worth it.
