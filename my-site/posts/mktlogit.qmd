## ⚡ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**The Objective:** Determine if Education level serves as a primary driver for marketing campaign acceptance.  
**Key Finding:** While Education initially appears significant, it is actually a proxy for **Income**. Income maintains a high correlation (0.82) with total spend and acts as a statistically significant predictor in logistic regression.

## 📋 Project Motivation
Using a [dataset provided by iFood](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data), we examine the relationship between a user's educational background and their likelihood to accept marketing offers.

# Applying Cubroot to stabilize variance
df['income_cuberoot'] = np.power(df['Income'], 0.333)


#| fig-cap: "The relationship between Household Income and Revenue"

#| echo: true
# Logistic Model
model = sm.Logit(df["AcceptedCmpOverall"], df['Income'])
