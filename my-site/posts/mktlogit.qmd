## ⚡ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**The Objective:** Determine if Education level serves as a primary driver for marketing campaign acceptance.  
**Key Finding:** While Education initially appears significant, it is actually a proxy for **Income**. Income maintains a high correlation (0.82) with total spend and acts as a statistically significant predictor in logistic regression.

## 📋 Project Motivation
Using a [dataset provided by iFood](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data), we examine the relationship between a user's educational background and their likelihood to accept marketing offers. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Initial Load (Correcting the filename from your snippet)
df = pd.read_csv("ifood_marketing_data.csv")
df.columns
# Applying Cubroot to stabilize variance
df['income_cuberoot'] = np.power(df['Income'], 0.333)

# Variance Check
# After transformation, the variance range dropped to ~3.4x, which 
# falls within the acceptable range for ANOVA (< 4x).
#| echo: true
f_stat, p_val = stats.f_oneway(
    df[df['education_Basic']==1]['income_cuberoot'],
    df[df['education_Graduation']==1]['income_cuberoot'],
    df[df['education_Master']==1]['income_cuberoot'],
    df[df['education_PhD']==1]['income_cuberoot']
)
print(f"F-statistic: {f_stat:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_val:.2e}")

# Logistic Model
