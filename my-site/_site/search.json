The goal was to isolate the causal impact of “Auto-Renew” features on churn, moving beyond simple correlation.\nThe Engineering: Leveraged DuckDB for lightning-fast local processing of large-scale Parquet/JSON files and dbt for modular, version-controlled transformations and data modeling.\nThe Analytics: Applied Double Machine Learning (DoubleML) to account for self-selection bias, identifying a 5% causal lift in retention directly attributable to auto-billing.\nThe Outcome: Successfully isolated a 5% causal lift in retention by de-biasing the “Self-Selection” effect (where loyalists are naturally more likely to opt-in). This provides a statistically sound foundation for projecting the ROI of auto-billing incentives. Robustness checks via DoubleML’s orthogonalization confirmed that the effect remained significant even after controlling for 15+ high-dimensional confounding variables (Income, Tenure, Usage Frequency)."
